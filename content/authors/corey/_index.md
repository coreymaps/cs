I am a PhD student using radar remote sensing to study terrestrial hydrologic processes and associated human impacts. I have interests where earth science and politics abut; and seek to develop insights from remote sensing observations that both support scientific research in terrestrial hydrology and diplomatic accountability in the management and monitoring of increasingly scarce freshwater resources. 

Before embarking on an academic career I was a social and environmental justice activist located in Oakland, CA. I worked on community-based police accountability as a volunteer with [Berkeley Copwatch](https://www.berkeleycopwatch.org) and helped organize the [direct action](https://www.occupythefarmfilm.com) that established the [Gill Tract Farm](https://www.gilltractfarm.org/) I became interested in greywater irrigation systems, working to install landry-to-landscape irrigation systems in backyards and urban farm projects beginning in 2010. In 2013, I decided to pursue a degree program in the natural sciences to be able to contribute work toward environemtal justice in the capacity of a technical expert.
