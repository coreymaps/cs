My doctoral research leverages geophysics, data engineering, and satellite imaging radar to study the physical impacts of war and conflict.

I'm a PhD candidate at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/earth-and-environmental-sciences) and work in close coordination with the [Conflict Ecology](https://www.conflict-ecology.org) group at Oregon State.

My work is focused at the intersection of science and humanitarian issues; relevant to journalistic reporting on the impacts of war and conflict. The results of my research studying war and conflict impacts are featured in reporting from organizations like the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/10/07/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-maps.html?smid=url-share#gaza-damage-nov-7), [Financial Times](https://ig.ft.com/gaza-damage/), [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/07/ethiopia-massacre-graves/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20415675), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/middleeast/map-humanitarian-aid-water-power-hospitals-gaza-strip-dg/), [Der Spiegel](https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/israel-gaza-krieg-der-konflikt-mit-der-hamas-in-grafiken-und-karten-a-3967f2d7-9923-47e1-9eed-a09c543d24bd), [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/09/1211571220/israel-gaza-damage-map-satellite-imagery), the [Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/what-happening-gaza-map-israel-hamas-lqc8q5zns), and [others](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XVQx97hH3n31XPoYimmIstnZUhof8a5Z5rt3Z2VZg4).
