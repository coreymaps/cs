I study relationships between natural hazards and political conflict through the gaze of satellite remote sensing.

I also collaborate on journalistic and humanitarian investigations at the intersection of conflict and environment. Some of my work supporting visual investigations has appeared in news outlets like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57845156), the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/israeli-spraying-of-herbicide-near-gaza-harming-palestinian-crops), and in [contemporary art exhibitions](https://u-jazdowski.pl/en/programme/exhibitions/forensic-architecture?tid=t_content) on environmental violence.
