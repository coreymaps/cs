I am a PhD student using remote sensing to study terrestrial hydrologic processes and associated human impacts. Where earth science and geopolitics abut, I seek to develop insights from remote sensing observations that support scientific research in terrestrial hydrology and diplomatic accountability in the management and monitoring of increasingly scarce freshwater resources. 

I was born and raised in Berkeley, CA.
