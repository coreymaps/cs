I'm a PhD student in Earth and Environmental Sciences at the [CUNY Grad Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/earth-and-environmental-sciences). The technical depth of my work is rooted in the science of [Earth observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_observation). The breadth of my work spans applications in terrestrial hydrology and cryospheric sciences to the physical and environmental aspects of geopolitical conflict.

I was born and raised in Berkeley, CA and am currently based in New York City. I sit at the [City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/eas) (CCNY) in West Harlem.
