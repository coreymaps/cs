I study geophysical aspects of geopolitical issues. My work applies a depth of technical expertise from the Earth sciences and [geodesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesy) to study transboundary water resources, international geohazards, and physical and environmental aspects of war and conflict.

I was trained in geology at [UC Berkeley](https://eps.berkeley.edu/home) under the supervision of [Walter Alvarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Alvarez) and gained exposure to environmental data science and Earth observation through a two-year apprenticeship under [Professor Laurel Larsen](https://geography.berkeley.edu/associate-professor-laurel-larsen). I am currently a PhD student at the [CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/earth-and-environmental-sciences) advised by Professor [Elia Machado](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/people/elia-machado). 

In addition to academic research, I also collaborate on journalistic and humanitarian investigations at the interface of conflict and environment. Some of my work supporting visual investigations has appeared in news outlets like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57845156), the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/israeli-spraying-of-herbicide-near-gaza-harming-palestinian-crops), and the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/07/ethiopia-massacre-graves/).
