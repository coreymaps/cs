Journalists at the Washington Post contacted me to help investigate the intentionality of flooding in rural and agricultural areas outside of Beijing, China that occurred at the end of July and early August of 2023. It was alleged and reported that Chinese authorities intentionally diverted floodwater to these rural areas, with little to no warning for residents, in order to save investments at nearby urban areas. It's estimated that this flooding dislplaced over 1.7 million people, caused $13 billion in economic losses, and killed dozens; although the total number of people who lost their lives may never be known.

A map of floodwater extent can tell us where and when surface water occurred but the imagery alone cannot determine whether floodwater came from natural water flow or an engineered floodwater release. The data I provided to the Post helped investigative journalists to verify witness accounts and, by including analyses of ancillary satellite optical data, conclude that a network of floodgates and engineered channels were used to sacrifice these rural areas for the sake of the urban investments.
