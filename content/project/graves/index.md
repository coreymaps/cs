Professor [Jamon Van Den Hoek](www.conflict-ecology.org) and I collaborated with the Washington Post to analyze changes in near infrared reflectance in very high resolution satellite imagery following allegations of a massacre of civilians in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. One of the sites that we identified was confirmed by a correspondent in the region as the location of new graves for civilians who were allegedly killed by Ethiopian forces. Read the full Washington Post story [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/07/ethiopia-massacre-graves/).
