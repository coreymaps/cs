Lack of *in situ* monitoring stations at extreme elevations limits how scientists can understand when mountain glaciers melt and for how long. I used over 32,000 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and a cloud computing platform to map glacier melt timing and duration over the entirety of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (76,831 glaciers).

A disconcerting observation we made extends [recent *in situ* observations]( https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0198.1) from the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest that shows glacier melt is occurring at temperatures that never exceed -10ºC. Melt retrievals from our study show there is meltwater persistence for up to three months of the year at the hgihest glaciated elevations on earth (>7,000m a.s.l).

An assumption that air temperatures greater than freezing must drive glacier melt used to build, "temperature indxed melt models," must now be retired for a new generation of models that simulate glacier ablation based on the surface energy balance.

Retreival of melt status, extent, and duration from SAR time series provides an observational dataset necessary to develop (real alternatives)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41657-5] to temperature indexed melt models of glacier ablation.
