Lack of *in situ* monitoring stations at extreme elevations limits how scientists can understand mountain glacier wasting with changes in global climate. I analyzed over 32,000 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images on a cloud computing platform to map glacier melt timing and duration over of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region (76,831 glaciers).

A disconcerting observation we made extends [recent *in situ* observations]( https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0198.1) from the Khumbu Glacier on Mount Everest that shows glacier melt occurring at temperatures that never exceed -10ºC. Melt retrievals from our study show there is meltwater persistence for up to two months of the year at the highest glaciated elevations on earth (>7,000m a.s.l).

	<figcaption>Timing of refreeze in the region of the Khumbu glacier, Mount Everest (2019). The red contour line at 6,300m shows the maximum elevation of an interpolated 0ºC isotherm; above that contour line interpolated air temperatures do not exceeed freezing. There is a signal of delayed refreeze within known regions of glacier percolation, where we hypothesize SAR backscatter gradually increases with an increase in depth of the frozen percolation zone.</figcaption>

An assumption that air temperatures above 0ºC drive glacier melt must now be retired for a new generation of glacier melt models based on the glacier surface energy balance.

Retreival of melt status, extent, and duration from SAR time series provides an observational constraint on melt timing and duration necessary to develop [real alternatives](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41657-5) to temperature indexed melt models of glacier ablation.
