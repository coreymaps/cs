### Important Note: this training is intended as a first-level introduction to interferometric coherent change detection for building damage mapping. The demonstration workflow is not something we recommend for commercialization or operation. If you need to operationalize a method for mapping building damage for real-world applications, please contact me directly.


I co-taught the first session with [Professor Jamon Van Den Hoek](https://www.conflict-ecology.org/) on monitoring urban damage during military conflict. We discussed the use of multitemporal [interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) [coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)) data to map proxies for damage to built infrastructure during military conflict.
