I will be co-teaching the first session with [Professor Jamon Van Den Hoek](https://www.conflict-ecology.org/) on monitoring urban damage during military conflict. I'll specifically discuss using multitemporal [interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar) [coherence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)) data to map proxies for damage to built infrastructure.
