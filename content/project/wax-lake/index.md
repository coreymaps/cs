I had the privilege to accompany [Professor Laurel Larsen](https://geography.berkeley.edu/associate-professor-laurel-larsen) and a research team she assembled to conduct a sediment tracer experiment in a flume we constructed in the Wax Lake Delta of Louisiana. The work was to support the role that vegetation plays in landform aggradation in one of the only [actively prograding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax_Lake) deltas on US coasts. Research like this is important to better understand how to protect vulnerable coastal environments from sea level rise by better managing the flow of riverine sediments.
