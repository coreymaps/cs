At the onset of the ongoing 2023 Israeli bombardment and invasion of the Gaza Strip, [Jamon Van Den Hoek](https://www.conflict-ecology.org/) and I operationalized an algorithmic workflow we developed over the two years prior to regularly update satellite radar-indicated building damage data over the Gaza Strip on a weekly basis throughout the duration of the ongoing conflict. 

Our data are visualized and referenced in [hundreds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XVQx97hH3n31XPoYimmIstnZUhof8a5Z5rt3Z2VZg4/edit?gid=522618229#gid=522618229) of articles in publications of record around the world,[several](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_XVQx97hH3n31XPoYimmIstnZUhof8a5Z5rt3Z2VZg4/edit?gid=1458698163#gid=1458698163) reports from prominent international humanitarian organizations, and as lines of evidence in a [legal proceeding](https://www.icj-cij.org/case/192) related to internaional humanitarian law. At a time when commercial image providers [limited access to data](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/inside-the-satellite-tech-revealing-gazas-destruction/), our assessments, based on open-access Earth observation radar imagery, were widely ingested as one of the few sources of information available capturing the scale and extent of impacts to the built environment in Gaza.

This work is ongoing and we continue monitor for signals of damage and destruction as the conflict unfolds.
